            My name is <b>Onuorah Onyinyechi</b>. I do not like <i>stress </i>and technology aids that. So what better way than to
            learn the programming of technology and create things and methods to help alleviate stress!

            So far, I have <b>learnt the concept of HTML and how important it is for the creation of web pages</b> . Don't get
            me wrong that's not the only thing I've learnt but that's the first that came to mind.
            Then there is <b>CSS the one that makes web pages</b> <i>(I am using web pages because I already started using it.
                LOL)</i> <b>have a bit of meaning and aids the flow of data on the page</b>. In my own simple English, it adds beauty,
            color and arrangement to an otherwise boring, one-flow HTML page.

        <p class="third-section">
            Paddings, margins and borders are CSS properties that are used to arrange/place the elements. There is 
            <i>the box model</i> that contains the content,padding,border and margin. <b>Padding</b> is the space around the content of
            the element that seperates it from the border of that element. <b>Border</b> is then between the margin and
            padding. I like to say border is the box around the content while the padding is the space around that
            content.<b> Margin</b> is then the outer lining of the element and is found between the border and the margin of a
            neighbouring element.
        </p>

            <i>Understanding how padding, border and margin works can help to place elements properly on a web page. Hope
                you enjoyed reading my POV of these three. BYE!!!</i>
